Any terms relating to programming concepts or technical concepts must be referenced first with the Main Glossary to find the preferred translation for said term. If a term cannot be found in the Main Glossary and is a HTML/CSS/Javascript related term, it should be looked up on MDN Simplified Chinese documentation. Any other terms can be looked up from the secondary glossaries or by search engine, prioritizing commonly used translation in Simplified Chinese.

Open a new issue if the Main Glossary should be changed or added to.
